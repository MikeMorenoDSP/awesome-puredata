A curated list of resources for visual programming language Pure Data.

## Distributions
- [Pd-Vanilla](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html) - main distribution, can install libraries through built in search tool, greater compatibility and performance.
- [Purr Data](https://www.purrdata.net/) - More visually pleasing, has some libraries included, great for beginners.
- [Pd-CEAMMC](https://github.com/uliss/pure-data/releases) - A Pd vanilla fork with a built-in library, tool bar and object list.
- [Pd-next](https://github.com/sebshader/pdnext/releases/) - A Pd vanilla fork with color customization.
- [La Malinette](http://malinette.info/en/?) - A more visual and modular version of Pd with custom abstractions.

## Libraries
- [else](https://github.com/porres/pd-else) - (externals) ELSE is a big library for Pure Data that provides a cohesive system for computer music, it also serves as a basis for an Live Electronics Tutorial by the same author, Alexandre Torres Porres.
- [CEAMMC](https://github.com/uliss/pure-data/releases) - (externals) General purpose Pd distribution and library used for work and education purposes in Centre of electoacoustic music of Moscow Conservatory (CEAMMC) and ZIL-electro studio.

*This library has plenty of GUI objects such as Knobs, Arrays, Sliders, Waveform Displays, etc.*
- [AudioLab](https://github.com/solipd/AudioLab) - (vanilla) A library of high level Pure Data abstractions with a focus on electroacoustic composition, live electronics and sound design.
- [mmb](https://github.com/dotmmb/mmb) - (vanilla) A library of Pure Data abstractions, with anti aliased oscillators, filters, etc.
- [Heavylib](https://github.com/enzienaudio/heavylib) - (vanilla) Library of Heavy compatible abstractions.
- [Deken Online](https://deken.puredata.info/) - Search pure data libraries online.

## Audiovisual Libraries
- [Gem](https://github.com/umlaeute/Gem) - Graphics Environment for Multimedia.
- [Ofelia](https://github.com/cuinjune/Ofelia) - Ofelia is a Pd external which allows you to use openFrameworks and Lua within a real-time visual programming environment for creating audiovisual artwork or multimedia applications such as games.

## Pure Data plugins
- [Completion plugin](https://github.com/HenriAugusto/completion-plugin) - This Gui-Plugin enables auto-completion for pure-data objects.

## Pd as an audio-plugin
- [Camomile](https://github.com/pierreguillot/Camomile/releases) - Camomile is a plugin with Pure Data embedded that allows to load and to control patches inside a digital audio workstation. The plugin is available in the VST2, VST3, Audio Unit and LV2 formats for Windows, Linux and MacOS.
- [Camomile ELSE](https://github.com/porres/Camomile-ELSE/releases) - Camomile plugin compatible with the else library.
- [Heavy Compiler or hvcc](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc) - hvcc is a python-based dataflow audio programming language compiler that generates C/C++ code and a variety of specific framework wrappers.
*This compiler can generate the following: c, bela, fabric, js, pdext, unity, daisy, vst2, lv2, jack, wwise.*
